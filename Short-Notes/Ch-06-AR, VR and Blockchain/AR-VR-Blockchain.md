# AR-Services
- Amazon Sumerian : lets you create and run virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D
applications quickly and easily without requiring any specialized programming or 3D graphics expertise.
With Sumerian, you can build highly immersive and interactive scenes that run on popular hardware
such as Oculus Go, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, Google Daydream, and Lenovo Mirage as well
as Android and iOS mobile devices. For example, you can build a virtual classroom that lets you train
new employees around the world, or you can build a virtual environment that enables people to tour
a building remotely. Sumerian makes it easy to create all the building blocks needed to build highly
immersive and interactive 3D experiences including adding objects (such as characters, furniture, and
landscape), and designing, animating, and scripting environments. Sumerian does not require specialized
expertise and you can design scenes directly from your browser.

# Blockchain-Service

- Amazon Managed Blockchain : is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and manage
scalable blockchain networks using the popular open source frameworks Hyperledger Fabric and
Ethereum.Blockchain makes it possible to build applications where multiple parties can execute transactions
without the need for a trusted, central authority. Today, building a scalable blockchain network with
existing technologies is complex to set up and hard to manage. To create a blockchain network, each
network member needs to manually provision hardware, install software, create and manage certiﬁcates
for access control, and conﬁgure networking components. Once the blockchain network is running, you
need to continuously monitor the infrastructure and adapt to changes, such as an increase in transaction
requests, or new members joining or leaving the network.
Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that allows you to set up and manage a scalable
blockchain network with just a few clicks. Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required
to create the network, and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications
running millions of transactions. Once your network is up and running, Managed Blockchain makes
it easy to manage and maintain your blockchain network. It manages your certiﬁcates, lets you easily
invite new members to join the network, and tracks operational metrics such as usage of compute,
memory, and storage resources. In addition, Managed Blockchain can replicate an immutable copy
of your blockchain network activity into Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB), a fully
managed ledger database. This allows you to easily analyze the network activity outside the network and
gain insights into trends.
