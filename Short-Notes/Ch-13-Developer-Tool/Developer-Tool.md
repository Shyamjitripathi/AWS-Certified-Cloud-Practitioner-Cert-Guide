experiment with AWS service APIs using the AWS SDKs, or use a range of other tools to be productive.
You can use CloudShell right from your browser and at no additional cost.
AWS CodeArtifact
AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that makes it easy for organizations of
any size to securely store, publish, and share software packages used in their software development
process. CodeArtifact can be conﬁgured to automatically fetch software packages and dependencies
from public artifact repositories so developers have access to the latest versions. CodeArtifactworks with
commonly used package managers and build tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and
NuGet making it easy to integrate into existing development workﬂows.
AWS CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces
software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don’t need to provision, manage, and
scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently,
so your builds are not left waiting in a queue. You can get started quickly by using prepackaged build
environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own build tools.
AWS CodeCommit
AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that makes it easy for companies to host
secure and highly scalable private Git repositories. AWS CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate
your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. You can use AWS CodeCommit
to securely store anything from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git
tools.
AWS CodeDeploy
AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to any instance, including EC2 instances
and instances running on premises. CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features,
helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your
applications. You can use CodeDeploy to automate software deployments, eliminating the need for
error-prone manual operations. The service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to
one instance or thousands.
AWS CodePipeline
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release
pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. CodePipeline automates the build,
test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change, based on the release
model you deﬁne. This enables you to rapidly and reliably deliver features and updates. You can easily
integrate CodePipeline with third-party services such as GitHub or with your own custom plugin. With
AWS CodePipeline, you only pay for what you use. There are no upfront fees or long-term commitments.
AWS CodeStar
AWS CodeStar enables you to quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. AWS CodeStar
provides a uniﬁed user interface, enabling you to easily manage your software development activities
in one place. AWS CodeStar, you can set up your entire continuous delivery toolchain in minutes,
allowing you to start releasing code faster. AWS CodeStar makes it easy for your whole team to work
together securely, allowing you to easily manage access and add owners, contributors, and viewers to
your projects. Each AWS CodeStar project comes with a project management dashboard, including an
integrated issue tracking capability powered by Atlassian JIRA Software. With the AWS CodeStar project
dashboard, you can easily track progress across your entire software development process, from your
backlog of work items to teams’ recent code deployments. For more information, refer to AWS CodeStar
features.
AWS Fault Injection Simulator
AWS Fault Injection Simulator is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS
that makes it easier to improve an application’s performance, observability, and resiliency. Fault injection
experiments are used in chaos engineering, which is the practice of stressing an application in testing
or production environments by creating disruptive events, such as sudden increase in CPU or memory
consumption, observing how the system responds, and implementing improvements. Fault injection
experiment helps teams create the real-world conditions needed to uncover the hidden bugs, monitoring
blind spots, and performance bottlenecks that are diﬃcult to ﬁnd in distributed systems.
AWS Fault Injection Simulator simpliﬁes the process of setting up and running controlled fault injection
experiments across a range of AWS services so teams can build conﬁdence in their application behavior.
With Fault Injection Simulator, teams can quickly set up experiments using pre-built templates that
generate the desired disruptions. AWS Fault Injection Simulator provides the controls and guardrails
that teams need to run experiments in production, such as automatically rolling back or stopping the
experiment if speciﬁc conditions are met. With a few clicks in the console, teams can run complex
scenarios with common distributed system failures happening in parallel or building sequentially over
time, enabling them to create the real world conditions necessary to ﬁnd hidden weaknesses.
AWS X-Ray
AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications in production or under
development, such as those built using a microservices architecture. X-Ray, you can understand how your
application and its underlying services are performing so you can identify and troubleshoot the root
cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel
through your application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components. You can use X-
Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications
to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.
