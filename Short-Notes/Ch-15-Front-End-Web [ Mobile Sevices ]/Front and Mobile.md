## FrontEnd-Web-Services

- Amazon Location Service : makes it easy for developers to add location functionality to applications
without compromising data security and user privacy.
Location data is a vital ingredient in today’s applications, enabling capabilities ranging from asset
tracking to location-based marketing. However, developers face signiﬁcant barriers when integrating
location functionality into their applications. This includes cost, privacy and security compromises, and
tedious and slow integration work.
Amazon Location Service provides aﬀordable data, tracking and geofencing capabilities, and native
integrations with AWS services, so you can create sophisticated location-enabled applications quickly,
without the high cost of custom development. You retain control of your location data with Amazon
Location, and you can combine proprietary data with data from the service. Amazon Location provides
cost-eﬀective location-based services (LBS) using high-quality data from global, trusted providers Esri
and HERE.

- Amazon Pinpoint : makes it easy to send targeted messages to your customers through multiple
engagement channels. Examples of targeted campaigns are promotional alerts and customer retention
campaigns, and transactional messages are messages such as order conﬁrmations and password reset
messages.
You can integrate Amazon Pinpoint into your mobile and web apps to capture usage data to provide you
with insight into how customers interact with your apps. Amazon Pinpoint also tracks the ways that your
customers respond to the messages you send—for example, by showing you the number of messages
that were delivered, opened, or clicked.
You can develop custom audience segments and send them pre-scheduled targeted campaigns via email,
SMS, and push notiﬁcations. Targeted campaigns are useful for sending promotional or educational
content to re-engage and retain your users.
You can send transactional messages using the console or the Amazon Pinpoint REST API. Transactional
campaigns can be sent via email, SMS, push notiﬁcations, and voice messages. You can also use the API
to build custom applications that deliver campaign and transactional messages.

- AWS Amplify makes it easy to create, conﬁgure, and implement scalable mobile applications powered by
AWS. Amplify seamlessly provisions and manages your mobile backend and provides a simple framework
to easily integrate your backend with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native frontends. Amplify also
automates the application release process of both your front-end and back-end allowing you to deliver
features faster.
Mobile applications require cloud services for actions that can’t be done directly on the device, such as
oﬄine data synchronization, storage, or data sharing across multiple users. You often have to conﬁgure,
set up, and manage multiple services to power the backend. You also have to integrate each of those
services into your application by writing multiple lines of code. However, as the number of application
features grow, your code and release process becomes more complex and managing the backend
requires more time.Amplify provisions and manages backends for your mobile applications. You just select the capabilities
you need such as authentication, analytics, or oﬄine data sync, and Amplify will automatically provision
and manage the AWS service that powers each of the capabilities. You can then integrate those
capabilities into your application through the Amplify libraries and UI components.

- AWS Device Farm : is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web
apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time. View video, screenshots, logs,
and performance data to pinpoint and ﬁx issues before shipping your app.

- AWS AppSync : is a serverless back-end for mobile, web, and enterprise applications.
AWS AppSync makes it easy to build data driven mobile and web applications by handling securely all
the application data management tasks such as online and oﬄine data access, data synchronization, and
data manipulation across multiple data sources. AWS AppSync uses GraphQL, an API query language
designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and ﬂexible syntax for describing their data
