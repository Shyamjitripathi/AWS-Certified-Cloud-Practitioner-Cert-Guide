Service (Amazon S3).
Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)
Amazon QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and
cryptographically veriﬁable transaction log owned by a central trusted authority. Amazon QLDB tracks
each and every application data change and maintains a complete and veriﬁable history of changes over
time.
Ledgers are typically used to record a history of economic and ﬁnancial activity in an organization. Many
organizations build applications with ledger-like functionality because they want to maintain an accurate
history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the history of credits and debits in banking
transactions, verifying the data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply
chain network. Ledger applications are often implemented using custom audit tables or audit trails
created in relational databases. However, building audit functionality with relational databases is time-
consuming and prone to human error. It requires custom development, and since relational databases are
not inherently immutable, any unintended changes to the data are hard to track and verify. Alternatively,
blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger. However,
this adds complexity as you need to set-up an entire blockchain network with multiple nodes, manage its
infrastructure, and require the nodes to validate each transaction before it can be added to the ledger.
Amazon QLDB is a new class of database that eliminates the need to engage in the complex
development eﬀort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data’s change
history is immutable – it cannot be altered or deleted – and using cryptography, you can easily verify
that there have been no unintended modiﬁcations to your application’s data. QLDB uses an immutable
transactional log, known as a journal, that tracks each application data change and maintains a complete
and veriﬁable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it provides developers with a
familiar SQL-like API, a ﬂexible document data model, and full support for transactions. QLDB is also
serverless, so it automatically scales to support the demands of your application. There are no servers to
manage and no read or write limits to conﬁgure. With QLDB, you only pay for what you use.
Amazon Timestream
Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service for IoT and
operational applications that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day at 1/10th the
cost of relational databases. Driven by the rise of IoT devices, IT systems, and smart industrial machines,
time-series data — data that measures how things change over time — is one of the fastest growing
data types. Time-series data has speciﬁc characteristics such as typically arriving in time order form, data
is append-only, and queries are always over a time interval. While relational databases can store this
data, they are ineﬃcient at processing this data as they lack optimizations such as storing and retrieving
data by time intervals.
Timestream is a purpose-built time series database that eﬃciently stores and processes this data by time
intervals. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze log data for DevOps, sensor data for IoT
applications, and industrial telemetry data for equipment maintenance. As your data grows over time,
the Timestream adaptive query processing engine understands its location and format, making your data
simpler and faster to analyze. Timestream also automates rollups, retention, tiering, and compression
of data, so you can manage your data at the lowest possible cost. Timestream is serverless, so there are
no servers to manage. It manages time-consuming tasks such as server provisioning, software patching,
setup, conﬁguration, or data retention and tiering, freeing you to focus on building your applications.
Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully
managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads.
