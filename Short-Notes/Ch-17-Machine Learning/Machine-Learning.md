excellence to identify anomalous application behavior (such as increased latency, error rates, resource
constraints, etc.) and surface critical issues that could cause potential outages or service disruptions.
When Amazon DevOps Guru identiﬁes a critical issue, it automatically sends an alert and provides a
summary of related anomalies, the likely root cause, and context about when and where the issue
occurred. When possible, Amazon DevOps Guru also provides recommendations on how to remediate the
issue.
Amazon DevOps Guru automatically ingests operational data from your AWS applications and provides
a single dashboard to visualize issues in your operational data. You can get started by enabling Amazon
DevOps Guru for all resources in your AWS account, resources in your AWS CloudFormation Stacks, or
resources grouped together by AWS Tags, with no manual setup or ML expertise required.Amazon Forecast
Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses ML to deliver highly accurate forecasts.
Companies today use everything from simple spreadsheets to complex ﬁnancial planning software to
attempt to accurately forecast future business outcomes such as product demand, resource needs, or
ﬁnancial performance. These tools build forecasts by looking at a historical series of data, which is called
time series data. For example, such tools may try to predict the future sales of a raincoat by looking only
at its previous sales data with the underlying assumption that the future is determined by the past. This
approach can struggle to produce accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends.
Also, it fails to easily combine data series that change over time (such as price, discounts, web traﬃc, and
number of employees) with relevant independent variables such as product features and store locations.
Based on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses ML to combine time series
data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no ML experience to get
started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may impact
your forecasts. For example, the demand for a particular color of a shirt may change with the seasons
and store location. This complex relationship is hard to determine on its own, but ML is ideally suited to
recognize it. Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically examine it, identify what
is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable of making predictions that are up to 50% more
accurate than looking at time series data alone.
Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no ML models to
build, train, or deploy. You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum fees and no upfront
commitments.
Amazon Fraud Detector
Amazon Fraud Detector is a fully managed service that uses ML and more than 20 years of fraud
detection expertise from Amazon, to identify potentially fraudulent activity so customers can catch
more online fraud faster. Amazon Fraud Detector automates the time consuming and expensive steps
to build, train, and deploy an ML model for fraud detection, making it easier for customers to leverage
the technology. Amazon Fraud Detector customizes each model it creates to a customer’s own dataset,
making the accuracy of models higher than current one-size ﬁts all ML solutions. And, because you pay
only for what you use, you avoid large upfront expenses.
Amazon HealthLake
Amazon HealthLake is a HIPAA-eligible service that healthcare providers, health insurance companies,
and pharmaceutical companies can use to store, transform, query, and analyze large-scale health data.
Health data is frequently incomplete and inconsistent. It's also often unstructured, with information

time-series data (for example, heart ECG or brain EEG traces).
Healthcare providers can use HealthLake to store, transform, query, and analyze data in the AWS
Cloud. Using the HealthLake integrated medical natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, you can
analyze unstructured clinical text from diverse sources. HealthLake transforms unstructured data using
natural language processing models, and provides powerful query and search capabilities. You can use
HealthLake to organize, index, and structure patient information in a secure, compliant, and auditable
manner.
Amazon Comprehend Medical
Over the past decade, AWS has witnessed a digital transformation in health, with organizations
capturing huge volumes of patient information every day. But this data is often unstructured and the
process to extract this information is labor-intensive and error-prone. Amazon Comprehend Medical is
a HIPAA-eligible natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning that has been
pre-trained to understand and extract health data from medical text, such as prescriptions, procedures,
or diagnoses. Amazon Comprehend Medical can help you extract information from unstructured

Amazon Monitron
Amazon Monitron is an end-to-end system that uses ML to detect abnormal behavior in industrial
machinery, enabling you to implement predictive maintenance and reduce unplanned downtime.
Installing sensors and the necessary infrastructure for data connectivity, storage, analytics, and alerting
are foundational elements for enabling predictive maintenance. However, to make it work, companies
have historically needed skilled technicians and data scientists to piece together a complex solution
from scratch. This included identifying and procuring the right type of sensors for their use cases and
connecting them together with an IoT gateway (a device that aggregates and transmits data). As a result,
few companies have been able to successfully implement predictive maintenance.
Amazon Monitron includes sensors to capture vibration and temperature data from equipment, a
gateway device to securely transfer data to AWS, the Amazon Monitron service that analyzes the data
for abnormal machine patterns using ML, and a companion mobile app to set up the devices and
receive reports on operating behavior and alerts to potential failures in your machinery. You can start
monitoring equipment health in minutes without any development work or ML experience required,
and enable predictive maintenance with the same technology used to monitor equipment in Amazon
Fulﬁllment Centers.
AWS Panorama
AWS Panorama is a collection of ML devices and software development kit (SDK) that brings computer
vision (CV) to on-premises internet protocol (IP) cameras. With AWS Panorama, you can automate tasks
that have traditionally required human inspection to improve visibility into potential issues.
Computer vision can automate visual inspection for tasks such as tracking assets to optimize supply
chain operations, monitoring traﬃc lanes to optimize traﬃc management, or detecting anomalies
to evaluate manufacturing quality. In environments with limited network bandwidth however, or for
companies with data governance rules that require on-premises processing and storage of video,
computer vision in the cloud can be diﬃcult or impossible to implement. AWS Panorama is an ML service
that allows organizations to bring computer vision to on-premises cameras to make predictions locally
with high accuracy and low latency.The AWS Panorama Appliance is a hardware device that adds computer vision to your existing IP cameras
and analyzes the video feeds of multiple cameras from a single management interface. It generates

Amazon Textract
Amazon Textract is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon
Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of ﬁelds in
forms and information stored in tables.
Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables,
and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual conﬁguration (which often must be
updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Amazon Textract
uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and
other data with no manual eﬀort. Amazon Textract provides you with the ﬂexibility to specify the data
you need to extract from documents using queries. You can specify the information you need in the
form of natural language questions (such as “What is the customer name”). You do not need to know
the data structure in the document (table, form, implied ﬁeld, nested data) or worry about variations
across document versions and formats. Amazon Textract Queries are pre-trained on a large variety of
documents including paystubs, bank statements, W-2s, loan application forms, mortgage notes, claims
documents, and insurance cards.
With Amazon Textract, you can quickly automate document processing and act on the information
