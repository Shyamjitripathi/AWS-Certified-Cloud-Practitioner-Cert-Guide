</ul>
	<li><strong>Multiple choice:</strong> Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple response:</strong> Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options</li>

incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose.
