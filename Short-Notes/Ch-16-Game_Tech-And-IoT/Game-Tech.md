# Game-Tech and IoT Services

- Amazon GameLift : is a managed service for deploying, operating, and scaling dedicated game servers
for session-based multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift makes it easy to manage server infrastructure,
scale capacity to lower latency and cost, match players into available game sessions, and defend from
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. You pay for the compute resources and bandwidth your
games actually use, without monthly or annual contracts.

- Amazon Lumberyard : is a free, cross-platform, 3D game engine for you to create the highest-quality
games, connect your games to the vast compute and storage of the AWS Cloud, and engage fans on
Twitch. By starting game projects with Lumberyard, you can spend more of your time creating great
gameplay and building communities of fans, and less time on the undiﬀerentiated heavy lifting of
building a game engine and managing server infrastructure

- AWS IoT 1-Click : is a service that enables simple devices to trigger AWS Lambda functions that can
execute an action. AWS IoT 1-Click supported devices enable you to easily perform actions such as
notifying technical support, tracking assets, and replenishing goods or services. AWS IoT 1-Click
supported devices are ready for use right out of the box and eliminate the need for writing your own
ﬁrmware or conﬁguring them for secure connectivity. AWS IoT 1-Click supported devices can be easily
managed. You can easily create device groups and associate them with a Lambda function that runs your
desired action when triggered. You can also track device health and activity with the pre-built reports.

- AWS IoT Analytics : is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to run and operationalize sophisticated
analytics on massive volumes of IoT data without having to worry about the cost and complexity
typically required to build an IoT analytics platform. It is the easiest way to run analytics on IoT data and
get insights to make better and more accurate decisions for IoT applications and machine learning use
cases.

- AWS IoT Core : is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with
cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT Core can support billions of devices and trillions of
messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and
securely. With AWS IoT Core, your applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices,
all the time, even when they aren’t connected.
