- AWS Application Cost Proﬁler : provides you the ability to track the consumption of shared AWS resources
used by software applications and report granular cost breakdown across tenant base.

- AWS Billing Conductor : is a fully managed service that can support the showback and charge-back
workﬂows of AWS Solution Providers and Enterprise customers. Using AWS Billing Conductor, you can
customize your monthly billing data. The console models the billing relationship between you and your
customers or business units. You can also customize a pro forma version of your billing data each month
to accurately show or charge back your customers.AWS Billing Conductor doesn't change the way that you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month.
Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to conﬁgure, generate, and display rates to certain customers
over a given billing period. You can also use it to analyze the diﬀerence between the rates you apply
to your accounting groupings relative to your actual rates from AWS. As a result of your AWS Billing
Conductor conﬁguration, the payer account can also see the custom rate that's applied on the billing
details page of the AWS Billing console, or conﬁgure a cost and usage report per billing group.

- AWS Cost Explorer : has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your
AWS costs and usage over time.

- AWS Budgets : gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed
(or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set RI utilization
or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you deﬁne. RI
alerts support Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon ElastiCache reservations.
Budgets can be tracked at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and
end dates.

- AWS Cost and Usage Report : is a single location for accessing comprehensive information about your
AWS costs and usage.The AWS Cost and Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service category used by an account and its
IAM users in hourly or daily line items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation
purposes.

- Savings Plans : is a ﬂexible pricing model oﬀering lower prices compared to On-Demand pricing, in
exchange for a speciﬁc usage commitment (measured in $/hour) for a one or three-year period. AWS
oﬀers three types of Savings Plans – Compute Savings Plans, Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans,
and Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans apply to usage across Amazon EC2,
AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. The Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans apply to EC2 usage, and
Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans apply to Amazon SageMaker usage.
