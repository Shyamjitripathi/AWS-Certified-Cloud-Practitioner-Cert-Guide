- AWS Application Cost Proﬁler : provides you the ability to track the consumption of shared AWS resources
used by software applications and report granular cost breakdown across tenant base. You can achieve
economies of scale with the shared infrastructure model, while still maintaining a clear line of sight to
detailed resource consumption information across multiple dimensions.With the proportionate cost insights of shared AWS resources, organizations running applications can
establish the data foundation for accurate cost allocation model, and ISV selling applications can better
understand your proﬁtability and customize pricing strategies for your end customers.
- AWS Billing Conductor : is a fully managed service that can support the showback and chargeback
workﬂows of AWS Solution Providers and Enterprise customers. Using AWS Billing Conductor, you can
customize your monthly billing data. The console models the billing relationship between you and your
customers or business units. You can also customize a pro forma version of your billing data each month
to accurately show or charge back your customers.AWS Billing Conductor doesn't change the way that you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month.
Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to conﬁgure, generate, and display rates to certain customers
over a given billing period. You can also use it to analyze the diﬀerence between the rates you apply
to your accounting groupings relative to your actual rates from AWS. As a result of your AWS Billing
Conductor conﬁguration, the payer account can also see the custom rate that's applied on the billing
details page of the AWS Billing console, or conﬁgure a cost and usage report per billing group.
You can conﬁgure the billing groups and pricing plans using the AWS Billing Conductor or the AWS
Billing Conductor API. For more information about AWS Billing Conductor service quotas, refer to Quotas
and restrictions.
- AWS Cost Explorer : has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your
AWS costs and usage over time. Get started quickly by creating custom reports (including charts and
tabular data) that analyze cost and usage data, both at a high level (such as total costs and usage across
all accounts) and for highly-speciﬁc requests (such as m2.2xlarge costs within account Y that are tagged
“project: secretProject”).
- AWS Budgets : gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed
(or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set RI utilization
or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you deﬁne. RI
alerts support Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon ElastiCache reservations.
Budgets can be tracked at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and
end dates. You can further reﬁne your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as
AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. Budget alerts can be sent via email and/or Amazon Simple
Notiﬁcation Service (Amazon SNS) topic.Budgets can be created and tracked from the AWS Budgets dashboard or via the AWS Budgets API.
- AWS Cost and Usage Report : is a single location for accessing comprehensive information about your
AWS costs and usage.The AWS Cost and Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service category used by an account and its
IAM users in hourly or daily line items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation
purposes. You can also customize the AWS Cost and Usage Report to aggregate your usage data to the
daily or monthly level.Reserved Instance (RI) reporting AWS provides a number of RI-speciﬁc cost management solutions out-of-the-box to help you better
understand and manage your RIs. Using the RI Utilization and Coverage reports available in AWS Cost
Explorer, you can visualize your RI data at an aggregate level or inspect a particular RI subscription. To
access the most detailed RI information available, you can leverage the AWS Cost and Usage Report. You
can also set a custom RI utilization target via AWS Budgets and receive alerts when your utilization drops
below the threshold you deﬁne.
- Savings Plans : is a ﬂexible pricing model oﬀering lower prices compared to On-Demand pricing, in
exchange for a speciﬁc usage commitment (measured in $/hour) for a one or three-year period. AWS
oﬀers three types of Savings Plans – Compute Savings Plans, Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans,
and Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans apply to usage across Amazon EC2,
AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. The Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans apply to EC2 usage, and
Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans apply to Amazon SageMaker usage. You can easily sign up a one-
or three-year term Savings Plans in AWS Cost Explorer and manage your plans by taking advantage of
recommendations, performance reporting, and budget alerts.
