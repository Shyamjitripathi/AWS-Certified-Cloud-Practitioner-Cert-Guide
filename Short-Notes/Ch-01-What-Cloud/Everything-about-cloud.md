## 1. What is cloud
Cloud computing is a way to access computer resources (like servers, storage, databases, software, and more) over the internet, instead of having those resources physically located on your own computer or in your office.Think of it like renting a car instead of owning one. With cloud computing, you don't need to worry about buying, installing, maintaining, or upgrading your own computer equipment and software. Instead, you can access the resources you need on-demand, pay for what you use, and easily scale up or down as your needs change.This makes it easier and more cost-effective for businesses and individuals to access the computing power they need without the hassle of managing their own infrastructure.
## 2. Six advanatges of cloud 
- Trade fixed expenses for variable expense.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale.
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money and maintaining data centers.
-  Go global in minutes.
## 3. Cloud-computing Models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) : is a cloud service that offers basic IT building blocks such as networking features, virtual computers, and storage space. It provides maximum flexibility and control over IT resources, similar to existing IT infrastructure.
 
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) : is a cloud service that eliminates the need for organizations to manage underlying infrastructure, such as hardware and operating systems. Instead, it allows them to focus on deploying and managing applications. This results in greater efficiency as organizations no longer have to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, or patching.

- Software as a Service (SaaS) : SaaS is a cloud service that provides a fully managed and completed product to end-users, with the service provider managing the underlying infrastructure. Users need only concern themselves with using the software provided, and not with maintaining the servers or adding features to the product. A typical example of a SaaS application is web-based email.


## 4. Cloud-Deployment Models

- Cloud-based applications : run fully in the cloud and can be built on low-level infrastructure or higher level services that abstract management, architecting, and scaling requirements.
- Hybrid deployment : connects cloud-based and non-cloud-based resources, most commonly on-premises infrastructure, to extend and grow an organization's infrastructure.
- On-premises deployment : uses virtualization and resource management tools and is sometimes called the "private cloud." It doesn't offer many cloud computing benefits but may provide dedicated resources, similar to legacy IT infrastructure.

## 5. Important terms 

- High availability: system which are designed to operate continuously without failure for long time.
- Elasticity : means you don't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need.
- Agility : means it will speed up your innovation and development time.
- Durability : means long-term data protection.
