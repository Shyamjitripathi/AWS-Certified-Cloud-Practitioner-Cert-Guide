## Response types
There are two types of questions on the exam:
</ul>
	<li><strong>Multiple choice:</strong> Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple response:</strong> Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options</li>
</ul><br>
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or
incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose.
