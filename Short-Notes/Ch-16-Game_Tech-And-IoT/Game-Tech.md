Amazon GameLift
Amazon GameLift is a managed service for deploying, operating, and scaling dedicated game servers
for session-based multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift makes it easy to manage server infrastructure,
scale capacity to lower latency and cost, match players into available game sessions, and defend from
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. You pay for the compute resources and bandwidth your
games actually use, without monthly or annual contracts.
Amazon Lumberyard
Amazon Lumberyard is a free, cross-platform, 3D game engine for you to create the highest-quality
games, connect your games to the vast compute and storage of the AWS Cloud, and engage fans on
Twitch. By starting game projects with Lumberyard, you can spend more of your time creating great
gameplay and building communities of fans, and less time on the undiï¬€erentiated heavy lifting of
building a game engine and managing server infrastructure
