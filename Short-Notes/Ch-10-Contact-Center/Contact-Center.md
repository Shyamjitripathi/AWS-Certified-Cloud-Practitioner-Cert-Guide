## Contact-Center-Service

- Amazon Connect : is a self-service, omnichannel cloud contact center service that makes it easy for any
business to deliver better customer service at lower cost. Amazon Connect is based on the same contact
center technology used by Amazon customer service associates around the world to power millions of
customer conversations. The self-service graphical interface in Amazon Connect makes it easy for non-
technical users to design contact ﬂows, manage agents, and track performance metrics – no specialized
skills required. There are no up-front payments or long-term commitments and no infrastructure to
manage with Amazon Connect; customers pay by the minute for Amazon Connect usage plus any
associated telephony services.

- Amazon Connect Cases :  a feature of Amazon Connect, allows your agents to track and manage customer
issues that require multiple interactions, follow-up tasks, and teams in your contact center. Agents
can document customer issues with all the relevant case details, such as date/time opened, issue
summary, customer information, and status, in a single uniﬁed view. You can conﬁgure new cases to
be automatically created or have agents create cases that document customers’ unique issues, such as
product defects and billing inquiries, and then track each case to resolution. And because Cases is built
into Amazon Connect, your agents can get started in a few clicks. By making it easier to track customer
issues, Cases makes it possible to accelerate resolution times, improve eﬃciency, and reduce errors to
help increase customer satisfaction.
