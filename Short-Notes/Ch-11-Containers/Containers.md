Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that
makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR is
integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), simplifying your development to
production workﬂow. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories or
worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highly available
and scalable architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy containers for your applications. Integration
with AWS Identity and Access Management (p. 80) (IAM) provides resource-level control of each
repository. With Amazon ECR, there are no upfront fees or commitments. You pay only for the amount of
data you store in your repositories and data transferred to the internet.
Amazon Elastic Container Service
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container
orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale
containerized applications on AWS. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install and operate your
own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines (VMs), or schedule
containers on those VMs.
With simple API calls, you can launch and stop Docker-enabled applications, query the complete state
of your application, and access many familiar features such as IAM roles, security groups, load balancers,
Amazon CloudWatch Events, AWS CloudFormation templates, and AWS CloudTrail logs.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale
containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.
Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure for you across multiple AWS Availability
Zones to eliminate a single point of failure. Amazon EKS is certiﬁed Kubernetes conformant so you can
use existing tooling and plugins from partners and the Kubernetes community. Applications running on
any standard Kubernetes environment are fully compatible and can be easily migrated to Amazon EKS
AWS App2Container
AWS App2Container (A2C) is a command-line tool for modernizing .NET and Java applications into
containerized applications. A2C analyzes and builds an inventory of all applications running in VMs,
on-premises or in the cloud. You simply select the application you want to containerize, and A2C
packages the application artifact and identiﬁed dependencies into container images, conﬁgures the
network ports, and generates the ECS task and Kubernetes pod deﬁnitions. A2C provisions, through AWS
CloudFormation, the cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines required to deploy the containerized .NET
or Java application into production. With A2C, you can easily modernize your existing applications and
standardize the deployment and operations through containers.
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides an integrated experience to use OpenShift. If you are
already familiar with OpenShift, you can accelerate your application development process by leveraging
familiar OpenShift APIs and tools for deployments on AWS. With ROSA, you can use the wide range of
AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning (ML), networking, mobile, and other services to
build secure and scalable applications faster. ROSA comes with pay-as-you-go hourly and annual billing,
a 99.95% SLA, and joint support from AWS and Red Hat.
ROSA makes it easier for you to focus on deploying applications and accelerating innovation by
moving the cluster lifecycle management to Red Hat and AWS. With ROSA, you can run containerized
applications with your existing OpenShift workﬂows and reduce the complexity of management.
